# Project-5-The-Metropolis-Hastings-algorithm

Position resection method is a method for finding unknown position by measuring angles with respect to known positions (reference points). The intersection of the drawn lines from those reference points reveals the unknown position. In this project we will estimate our location on a map using the position resection method. The uncertainty of the positioning algorithm is studied, and the distribution of plausible locations is obtained.
